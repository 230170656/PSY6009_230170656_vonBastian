This study used data requested from a larger study conducted by von Bastian et al. (2022) under
collaboration between the University of Sheffield, University of Montreal, and Medical School of 
Hamburg. The author of this thesis does not have permission to share data or materials.

Because of this, the current codebook identifies variables used within the script. This is to 
facilitate more fluid interaction with - and understanding of - the variables used to compile results.



######################## RAW DATA CSVs

These notations title the original raw data CSVs which were loaded into R, and identify the specific
measures taken within each file which were extracted for usage within later analysis.
 
# data-frames

home_survey = Home Assessment Survey (inc. code, site, Grit, demographics)
lab_survey = Lab Survey Data compiled across all three time-points (inc. Mindset, Self-Efficacy)
filter = Inclusions Tracker to identify how many sessions participants had completed

simple_data = Lab Assessment Data compiled across all three time-points*, (inc. Simple RT Task)
choice_data = *, (inc. Choice RT Task)
switch_data = *, (inc. Switching RT Task)
dual_data = *, (inc. Dual-attention RT Task)
wm_updating = *, (inc. Working Memory Updating Task)
wm_binding = *, (inc. Working Memory Binding Task)
wm_reproduction = *, (inc. Working Memory Reproduction Error Task)
reas_rapm = *, (inc. Reasoning Matrix (Reasoning) Task)
reas_lettersets = *, (inc. Reasoning Lettersets Task)
reas_paperfolding = *, (inc. Reasoning Paperfolding Task)



######################## PROCESSED DATA

These notations identify each variable within the processed data used to conduct final analyses. There
are no missing values within this data as missingness breached eligibility for participant inclusion.

processed_data = Processed Data compiling all necessary variables for analysis, inc.

# variables
